# game-landing-page

A mockup-to-website example to be used as an assessment

## Getting started

- Create a new repository of create a new branch in an existing folder
- If you created a new repository, clone it onn your local computer
- Work in your `main` branch

## The design

I'd recommend downloading the Figma App if you haven't already.

### On Figma.com

You can [find the mockup on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/TQbxiZSrdlXzn5SWfhMoA9/Game-landing-page-Responsive)

## Resources

I've extracted all the images in multiple formats, and placed them in the `source-materials/imagery` folder.

## Development

It is good to create a `webroot` folder for your work. Create all the folder you need such as `css`, `images` and the `index.html` file.

## Sources

To make everything run up nicely:

- Install node-sass
- Install `package.json`
- Run the your  `css:watch` or whatever name you give it on your `package` file

- When you've created a new file sass file, remember to watch that new file.
